### User Input

@[prompter/vora-web-app/Generating User Stories.md] 

### Planner Response

Let me start by reading the referenced file to understand the task.

*Viewed [Generating User Stories.md](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app/Generating%20User%20Stories.md) *

### Planner Response

I can see this is a conversation log documenting the progress of generating user stories. It looks like the previous conversation started generating stories for EPICs 001 and 002, and was working on EPIC-003 when it ended. Let me check the current state of the stories directory and the workflow file to continue the work.

*Listed directory [vora-web-app](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app) *

*Viewed [story-generator.md](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/.agent/workflows/story-generator.md) *

### Planner Response

Now let me check the current state of the stories directory to see what was already generated:

*Listed directory [stories](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app/stories) *

*Listed directory [EPIC-001-project-foundation](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app/stories/EPIC-001-project-foundation) *

*Listed directory [EPIC-002-user-authentication](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app/stories/EPIC-002-user-authentication) *

*Listed directory [epics](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app/epics) *

### Planner Response

I can see that stories have been generated for **EPIC-001** and **EPIC-002**, but **EPIC-003 through EPIC-010** still need stories. The previous conversation was interrupted while starting EPIC-003. Let me now read all the remaining EPICs and the FSD to generate the missing stories.

*Viewed [EPIC-003-category-management.md](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app/epics/EPIC-003-category-management.md) *

### Planner Response

Now let me also read the existing stories to understand the naming conventions and patterns used:

*Viewed [README.md](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app/stories/EPIC-001-project-foundation/README.md) *

*Viewed [README.md](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app/stories/EPIC-002-user-authentication/README.md) *

*Searched filesystem*

### Planner Response

Let me also read one example story to understand the exact format:

*Viewed [STORY-001-login-page-ui.md](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app/stories/EPIC-002-user-authentication/Frontend/STORY-001-login-page-ui.md) *

*Viewed [fsd.md](file:///c:/Users/FADIA/Target-Tracking-Goal/prompter/vora-web-app/fsd.md) *

### Planner Response

I now have comprehensive context from all 8 remaining EPICs, the FSD, and the existing story format. Let me now generate stories for all remaining EPICs (003-010). I'll start with EPIC-003 through EPIC-005.
